This project demonstrates how to integrate vet.domains with a React application.

It includes the following features:

1. Showing a name for a given address using hooks.
2. Showing an address for a given name using an asynchronous function.
3. A sample input component that identifies names and changes them to addresses before the `onChange` event is triggered.
4. A sample component that returns a name or address for any given value
